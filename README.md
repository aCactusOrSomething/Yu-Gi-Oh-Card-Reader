# YUGIOH CARD VIEWER

## About

This website displays cards from the game "Yu Gi Oh" with reformatted text for readability and accessibility.

The text reformatting is done automatically via javascript. The backend is a standard Ruby on Rails application with a Postgres database.

The card text itself is written by [Konami](https://www.yugioh-card.com/), and the database is seeded by referencing [YGOPRODeck's API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/).

## How To Use

An active deployment of the website can be found [here](https://ygo-card-reader-beaa7b503767.herokuapp.com/cards). Cards can be searched for by name using the bar at the top.

## Development Environment Setup
