  <h1>YU GI OH Card Reader</h1>
  <h2>About:</h2>
  This website formats the text of Yu-Gi-Oh cards in a way that is (hopefully) accessible and easy to read. Features include:
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic line breaks and indentation are applied to card effect text</li>
    <li>Abbreviated terms (such as "GY" for "graveyard") are marked and labeled</li>
    <li>Key words tied to specific game mechanics are detected on each card, and presented alongside links to relevant wiki pages</li>
    <li>Special characters in a card's name are excluded when searching for it (You can find "Evilâ˜…Twin" cards by just searching "evil twin", for instance)</li>
  </ul>
</section>
